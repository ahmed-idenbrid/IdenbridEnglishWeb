Her previous website was not doing her justice and engarment levels were low. With a plethora of experience in such a highly specialized field, our aim was to bring more attention and awereness to her as a brand and everything she has to offer. Due to her outdated website and bookign system, she was missing out on potential sales and user interaction. This often meant that clients would want to book with her but were often not able to complete their purchase due to the constraints of her booking system.

                                                The system we developed for Anmarie Uber needed to be easy enough to navigate so that users could complete their bookings and purchases, but still allow for an interesting user experience on her website. To ensure bsusiness growth, the website also needed to account for new customers and website visits from users who did not know much about her. We created a website that would account for both types of users in a seamless and visually pleasing way.
